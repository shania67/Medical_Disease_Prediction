# Medical_Disease_Prediction
The project is designed to assist in the early identification of diseases using patient's health data. By analyzing various medical parameters such as symptoms, lab test results and lifestyle information, the system predicts the likelihood of a patient suffering from specific diseases. This helps healthcare providers in providing better treatment.
